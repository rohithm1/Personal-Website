The purpose of this project is to build a collaborative graphical editor â€” akin to Google Docs' ability to have multiple simultaneous editors of the same document. In both cases, multiple clients connect to a server, and whatever editing any of them does, the others see. So I can add an ellipse, a friend on another computer can recolor and move it, etc.
